## Intro

This is a basic sprint planner that is built using [NextJS 14](https://nextjs.org/) and [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas). The minimum Node version is 18.17.0, and you will need to [create a MongoDB Atlas account](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) to make use of a Database and also provide a URI.

## Config

Create a Database called "sprintPlanner" and a collection called "tickets" in your Atlas account. Ensure that you create a .env file in your root directory, and place your MONGO_URI in it...
